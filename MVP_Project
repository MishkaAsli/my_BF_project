Target Audience: Individuals trying to buy shoes to eventually resell.

Preliminary Analysis: Exploratory Analysis and visualization of the median rate of return of some of the Adidas and Nike shoes sold on StockX.

Future Analysis: Build a predictive model of Adidas and Nike shoe sales on StockX for a given colorway and shoe size, to inform future pricing and optimize revenue for individual sellers.

Opportunity: Purchasing shoes is currently done by “gut feeling” business rules. The StockX website also currently shows stats on one shoe and not the stats in relation to other similar shoes. This analysis could help optimize revenue for individual sellers on StockX.  

Impact Hypothesis: We want to optimize revenue of shoes individual sellers sell on StockX. We hypothesize that finding the shoes with the highest return on investments and then predicting the shoe price of future shoe releases will enable us to do that. We will use highest return on shoe investments and forecasting to reduce loss, save time, reduce guessing and “gut feeling” of which shoes to buy and maximize the return on investments. 

Solution Path:
1)Build the best regression model and iterate through different feature engineering techniques.
2) Predict sale price of future shoe releases and present this information to potential sellers.
3)Constantly add to and improve on the model.
